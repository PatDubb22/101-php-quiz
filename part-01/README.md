## Part One: Multi-Page Quiz

---

Build out a multi-page quiz.

---

### PHP

You will be building a quiz with a landing page, pages for each question, and a final results page.

Each question will be multiple choice, with [radio buttons](http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_form_radio) form elements for the user to select the correct answer.

Each time a user submits an answer to their question, they are taken to the page for the next question (meaning their form submits to the page for that question). 

You will need to track your current question, your current score, and your answer to each question in query parameters.

### Front-End Layout and Style
